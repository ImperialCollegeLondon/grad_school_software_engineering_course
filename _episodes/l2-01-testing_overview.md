objectives:
- "Appreciate the benefits of testing research software"
- "Understand what testing can and can't achieve"

keypoints:
- "Testing is the standard approach to software quality assurance"
- "Testing helps to ensure that code performs its intended function: well-tested code is likely to be more reliable, correct and malleable"
- "Good tests thoroughly exercise critical code"
- "Code without any tests should arouse suspicion, but it is entirely possible to write a comprehensive but practically worthless test suite"
- "Testing can contribute to performance, security and long-term stability as the size of the codebase and its network of contributors grows"
- "Testing can ensure that software has been installed correctly, is portable to new platforms, and is compatible with new versions of its dependencies"
- "In the context of research software, testing can be used to validate code i.e. ensure that it faithfully implements scientific theory"
- "Unit (e.g. a function); Functional (e.g. a library); and Regression, (e.g. a bug) are three commonly used types of tests"
- "Test coverage can provide a coarse- or fine-grained metric of comprehensiveness, which often provides a signal of code quality"
- "Automated testing is another such signal: it lowers friction; ensures that breakage is identified sooner and isn't released; and implies that machine-readable instructions exist for building and code and running the tests"
- "Testing ultimately contributes to sustainability i.e. that software is (and remains) fit for purpose as its functionality and/or contributor-base grows, and its dependencies and/or runtime environments change"

### Why Test?

There are a number of compelling reasons to properly test a research code:

* Show that physical laws or mathematical relationships are correctly encoded
* Check that code works when running on a new system
* Make sure new code changes do not break existing functionality
* Ensure code correctly handles edge or corner cases
* Persuade others your code is reliable
* Check that code works with new or updated dependencies

Whilst testing might seem like an intimidating topic the chances are you're
already doing testing in some form. No matter the level of experience, no
programmer ever just sits down and writes some code, is perfectly confident that
it works and proceeds to use it straight away in research. Instead development
is in practice more piecemeal - you generally think about a simple input and the
expected output then write some simple code that works. Then, iteratively, you
think about more complicated example inputs and outputs and flesh out the code
until those work as well. When developers talk about testing all this means is
formalising the above process and making it automatically repeatable on demand.

This has numerous advantages over a more ad hoc approach:

* Provides a record of the tests that have been carried out
* Faster development times - get feedback on changes quickly
* Encourages writing more modular code
* Ensures breakages are caught early in development
* Prevent manual testing mistakes

As you're performing checks on your code anyway it's worth putting in the time
to formalise your tests and take advantage of the above.

> ## A Hypothetical Scenario

> Your supervisor has tasked you with implementing an obscure statistical method
> to use for some data analysis. Wanting to avoid unnecessary work you check
> online to see if an implementation exists. Success! Another researcher has
> already implemented and published the code.
>
> You move to hit the download button, but a worrying thought occurs. How do you
> know this code is right? You don't know the author or their level of
> programming skill. Why should you trust the code?
>
> Now turn this question on its head. Why should your colleagues or supervisor
> trust any implementation of the method that you write? Why should you trust
> work you did a year ago? What about a reviewer for a paper?

> invested time in the checking the correctness of their code. You can even see
> exactly the tests they've tried and add your own if you're not
> satisfied. Conversely, any code that lacks tests should be viewed with
> suspicion as you have no record of what quality assurance steps have been
> taken.

### Types of Testing

This isn't a topic we will discuss in much detail but is worth mentioning as the
jargon here can be another factor that is intimidating. In fact there are entire
[websites](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com) dedicated to explaining the
different types of testing. Ultimately, however there are only a few types of
testing that we need to worry about.

#### Unit Testing

The main type of testing kind we will be dealing with in this course. Unit
testing refers to taking a component of a program and testing it in
isolation. Generally this means testing an individual class or function. This is
part of the reason that testing encourages more modular and sustainable code
development. You're encouraged to write your code into functionally independent
components that can be easily unit tested.

#### Functional Testing

Unlike unit testing that focuses on independent parts of the system, functional
testing checks the compliance of the system overall against a defined set of
criteria. In other words does the software as a whole do what it's supposed to
do?

#### Regression Testing

This refers to the practice of running previously written tests whenever a new
change is introduced to the code. This is good to do even when making seemingly
insignificant changes. Carrying out regression testing allows you to remain
confident that your code is functioning as expected even as it grows in
complexity and capability.

### Testing Done Right

It's important to be clear about what software tests are able to provide and
what they can't. Unfortunately it isn't possible to write tests that completely
guarantee that your code is bug free or provides a one hundred percent faithful
implementation of a particular model. In fact it's perfectly possible to write
an impressive looking collection of tests that have very little value at all.
What should be the aim therefore when developing software tests?

In practice this is difficult to define universally but one useful mantra is
that good tests ***thoroughly exercise critical code***. One way to achieve this
is to design test examples of increasing complexity that cover the most general
case the unit should encounter. Also try to consider examples of special or edge
cases that your function needs to handle especially.

A useful quantitative metric to consider is **test coverage**. Using additional
tools it is possible to determine, on a line-by-line basis, the proportion of a
codebase that is being exercised by its tests. This can be useful to ensure, for
instance, that all logical branching points within the code are being used by
the test inputs.

> ## Testing and Coverage
>
> Consider the following Python function:
>
> ```python
> def recursive_fibonacci(n):
>     """Return the n'th number of the fibonacci sequence"""
>     if n <= 1:
>         return n
>     else:
>         return recursive_fibonacci(n - 1) + recursive_fibonacci(n - 2)
> ```
>
> Try to think up some test cases of increasing complexity, there are four
> distinct cases worth considering. What input value would you use for each case
> and what output value would you expect? Which lines of code will be exercised
> by each test case? How many cases would be required to reach 100% coverage?
>
> For convenience, some initial terms from the Fibonacci sequence are given
> below:  
> 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21
>
> > ## Solution
> >
> > ### Case 1 - Use either 0 or 1 as input

> > **Correct output:** Same as input  
> > **Coverage:** First section of if-block  
> > **Reason:** This represents the simplest possible test for the function. The

> > ### Case 2 - Use a value > 1 as input
> >
> > **Correct output:** Appropriate value from the Fibonacci sequence  
> > **Coverage:** All of the code  
> > **Reason:** This is a more fully fledged case that is representative of the

> > **Correct output:** Depends...  
> > **Coverage:** First section of if-block

> > ### Case 4 - Use a non-integer input e.g. 3.5
> >
> > **Correct output:** Depends...  
> > **Coverage:** Whole function  
> > **Reason:** This is similar to case 3, but may not arise in more strongly
> > typed languages. What should the function do here? Work as is? Raise an
> > error? Round to the nearest integer?

### Summary

The importance of automated testing for software development is difficult to
overstate. As testing on some level is always carried out there is relatively
low cost in formalising the process and much to be gained. The rest of this
course will focus on how to carry out unit testing.
