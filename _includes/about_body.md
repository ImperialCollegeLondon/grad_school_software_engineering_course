This course was developed by the Research Computing Service (RCS) of Imperial 
College, in particular by the Research Software Engineering (RSE) team. The RSE 
team are a part of Imperial ICT combining specialist knowledge in software 
engineering with extensive experience in research. The team works with academic 
groups on a wide range of projects whilst also organising community events and 
training (such as this) for the benefit of the research community. You can find 
out more at the [RSE team website][RSE] and the [Imperial RSE Community 
website][community]. You can also consult the expertise of the RSE team at the 
fortnightly [Code Surgeries][surgery].
