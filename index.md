Programming as a researcher can be a very intimidating experience. It
can feel as though your code isn't "good enough" (as judged by some
mysterious and opaque criteria), or that you're not coding in the
"right way". The aim of this course is to help to address some of
these concerns through an introduction to software engineering for
researchers. Beyond just programming, software engineering is the
practice and principle of writing software that is correct,
sustainable and ready to share with colleagues and the wider research
community.

This course covers: 
* Techniques and tools to improve the readability and quality of your code 
* Structuring your code in a modular fashion to promote reuse and future extension
* Testing frameworks and how to write tests
